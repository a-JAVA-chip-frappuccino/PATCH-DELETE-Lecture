# PATCH-DELETE-Lecture

## Help perform a PATCH and DELETE request using the allocated buttons!

### To run the JSON server and be able to perform all necessary `fetch` requests, run:

`json-server --watch db.json`

### To open the HTML file, run:

`open index.html`

### Make sure to run these in two separate terminals, as we will be using the server terminal continuously as we test each `fetch` request!

#### Steps for PATCH request:
#### 1. `fetch` user's particular ID
#### 2. Set headers, method to PATCH, and body
#### 3. Ensure that body is valid object syntax
#### 4. Fire patch and return updated JSON object

#### Steps for DELETE request:
#### 1. `fetch` user's particular ID
#### 2. Set method to DELETE
#### 3. Fire DELETE and return no JSON object
