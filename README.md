# PATCH-DELETE-Lecture

## Help perform a PATCH and DELETE request using the allocated buttons!

### To run the JSON server and be able to perform all necessary `fetch` requests, run:

`json-server --watch db.json`

### To open the HTML file, run:

`open index.html`

### Make sure to run these in two separate terminals, as we will be using the server terminal continuously as we test each `fetch` request!
